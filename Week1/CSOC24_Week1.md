# CHALLENGE 1
## Information
    Commands: file, exiftool
Check from the 'file' command if it is really .jpg file. Then to look for the files info or details I used the 'exiftool' command. In the exiftool I found out long strings. <br>
![1](Challenge1/1.jpg) <br>
Trying a random method of converting those strings from base64 and got the flag.

## Matryoshka Doll
    Commands: file, binwalk, binwalk -e, cat
By using 'binwalk' command, we can see that is has hidden zip files in it. Use 'binwalk -e' command to unzip the files. <br>
![](Challenge1/2.1.jpg) <br>
Proceed with the same procedure till you get a text file. <br>
![](Challenge1/2.2.jpg) <br>
Read the text file. <br>

## tunn3l v1s10n
    Commands:file, xxd, mv, binwalk
Using the file command we get nothing useful. Type 'xxd' command and there we get the initials as 'BM' which denotes a bitmap file. Change the extension of the file by 'mv' command and try to open it. Nothing happens <br>
![](Challenge1/3.1.jpg) <br>
Open the hex values of the given file. (used this site for hex values https://hexed.it/) <br>
![](Challenge1/3.2.jpg) <br>
Download a random bitmap image from the browser and compare the initial hex values. <br>
![](Challenge1/3.3.jpg) <br>
Make the required changes in the hex values by comparing both the files. <br>
![](Challenge1/3.4.jpg) <br>
Try to open the image and the image opens but we do not get a correct flag. <br>
![](Challenge1/3.5.jpg) <br>
Using the exiftool look for the details of the file. We can observe a huge difference in the image height ad width. <br>
![](Challenge1/3.6.jpg) <br>
Open python idle and convert image height and width into hex values and find it in the hex values of the file. <br>
![](Challenge1/3.7.jpg) <br>
Try all sorts of hex values for the image height till you observe something else. <br>
![](Challenge1/3.8.jpg) <br>
And yesss... U got the flag <br>

## MacroHard WeakEdge
    Commands: file, unzip, cat
Use the usual 'file' command. Unzip the .pptm file. <br>
![](Challenge1/4.1.jpg) <br>
In the last there is a file called hidden. Read the file and you'll get some chracters. Try decoding it from base64.
(used this link https://www.base64decode.org/).... Yess you got the flag. <br>

## Enhance!
    Commands: binwalk, mv
Changed the name of the downloaded file as per my convenience. Use the command 'binwalk' to check for the file type and extensions. Use 'mv' command to change the file extension. <br>
![](Challenge1/5.1.jpg) <br>
Open the .xml file in notepad and notice it carefully. It is a flag. <br>

## Advanced Potion Making
    Commands: file, exiftool, xxd
Tried 'file' and 'exiftool' but got no information. Look for the hex values by 'xxd' command.The initial hex values are similar to that of the .png file (source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures). <br>
![](Challenge1/6.1.jpg) <br>
Change the hex values to its default value. Look for its height and width and change it accordingly. <br>
![](Challenge1/6.2.jpg) <br>
![](Challenge1/6.5.jpg) <br>
![](Challenge1/6.3.jpg) <br>
Nothing is useful when we open the file. Use online stegsolve platforms and use its tools.

## File Types
    Commands: file, mv, binwalk, lzip, lzop, lzma, xd
Using the 'file' command we get to know the file is a shell archive. Copy the file and rename the file with extension .sh. Execute the file. There is a uudecode error. <br>
![](Challenge1/7.1.jpg) <br>
Install uudecode. After installing it works.. <br>
![](Challenge1/7.2.jpg) <br>
Check for the list of files. There is a new file 'flag' in it. Chech its extension using 'file' command. It is an archive file so extract its content using 'binwalk' command. There are multiple compressions so install libraries if not there and keep decompressing. Also rename the file if there is an error occuring due to unknown suffix. <br>
![](Challenge1/7.3.jpg) <br>
![](Challenge1/7.4.jpg) <br>
![](Challenge1/7.5.jpg) <br>
![](Challenge1/7.6.jpg) <br>
![](Challenge1/7.7.jpg) <br>
Ascii text is given in the last file. Convert it from base64 or hex values to get the flag. Hex conversion works. <br>

## HIDEME
    Commands: file, exiftool, binwalk, unzip
Start with the regular and most common commands. By 'binwalk' command we get to know a there is another image inside this image in a zip file. <br>
Unzip it and go to the secret folder to open the image. <br>

## MSB
    Commands: python3, ls
Firstly I tried all sorts of methods like using commands that are used for steganography and visiting online platforms for steganography. <br>
On the online steganography platforms, solving via LSB is given but not for MSB. I searched for the code online to get the data through MSB(as the name of the challenge says) and got this github link (https://github.com/Pulho/sigBits). <br>
![](Challenge1/9.1.jpg) <br>
I copied the code in my vscode and executed it on my terminal as per the given instructions. <br>
![](Challenge1/9.2.jpg) <br>
Then I opened the file and by the 'find' method found the flag. <br>
